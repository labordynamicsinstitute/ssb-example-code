# Example code for SSB users on the Synthetic Data Server

## Definitions
- SSB = [SIPP Synthetic Beta File](https://www2.vrdc.cornell.edu/news/data/sipp-synthetic-beta-file)
- SDS = [Synthetic Data Server](https://www2.vrdc.cornell.edu/news/synthetic-data-server/), set up to provide early access to new synthetic data products by the U.S. Census Bureau. These datasets are made available to interested researchers in a controlled environment, prior to a more generalized release.

## Purpose of this code
To show SSB users how to use an already-existing package (IVEware) to handle missing data and showing start-to-finish code from data loading to finished results based on different choices about handling missing data, creating replicate weights, combining results, and generating output.

The programs are meant to be a starting place/example for users who want to address missing data on their own rather than a versatile finished product. They are written  such that they hopefully involve very little tweaking for the less interested users.
